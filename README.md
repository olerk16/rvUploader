Angular app to parse rv csv data and display in a table on ui

instead of using a library to parse the CSV file I went with a dynamic manual approach
for the ascending and descending filtering of values in the table I went for a directive aproach
when it came to searching for values within the table I used the pipe aproach with a reactive form
